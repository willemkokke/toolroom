"""Typed bridges to command-line tools, built on `footman.run`.

Every call runs through the current task context, so it inherits capture,
replay-on-failure, dry-run, recording, and `--json` steps.

footman deliberately does **not** transcribe each tool's flags into Python
parameters. Transcription drifts: the wrapper pins the flag-set its author
copied, the tool moves on, and one day `show_source=True` emits a flag the
installed binary rejects. Instead, keyword arguments translate
*mechanically* — the installed tool's own CLI stays the single source of
truth, at whatever version it is:

- `fix=True` → `--fix` (`False`/`None` → omitted entirely)
- `strict=off` → `--no-strict` (disable a default-on flag; `off` is the
  `footman.tools.off` sentinel — `no_strict=True` is the same thing by name)
- `output_format="github"` → `--output-format github`
- `select=["E", "F"]` → `--select E --select F` (an empty list/tuple is
  omitted entirely, so a task param's default passes straight through)
- `x=1` (single letter) → `-x 1`
- a trailing underscore escapes Python keywords: `import_="x"` → `--import x`

Attribute access chains subcommands (`tools.docker.compose.up(detach=True)`
→ `docker compose up --detach`), positional strings pass through verbatim,
and *any* executable works without being declared here:
`tools.terraform("plan")` just runs `terraform plan`.

`tool.installed_version()` returns the installed binary's version as an int
tuple (cached per process, resolved outside the task context so dry-run and
recording can't lie to it) — for the rare case where a task must branch on
the tool's actual CLI generation.

class Tool:
    """One command-line tool; see the module docstring for the grammar.

    `in_process` (footman run-control set via `.opts()`, like `nofail`) runs a
    Python tool inside footman's process instead of spawning: the tool's own
    `[console_scripts]` entry point is resolved and invoked — the same
    no-transcription contract, minus the interpreter spawn. Beyond speed
    this matters for correctness: on macOS, SIP strips `DYLD_*` from child
    processes, so a tool that needs Homebrew's native libraries (mkdocs
    with cairo, say) can only see them in-process, where an env var set
    before the import sticks. Tools constructed with `in_process=True`
    default to it and fall back to a subprocess when no entry point is
    installed; `.opts(in_process=True)` is a demand and errors if the entry
    can't be found. Parallelism survives: entries that accept an
    argument list (click commands, `main(argv=None)` — detected from the
    signature) are called directly and capture through the per-task stdout
    router; even a legacy zero-arg `main()` parallelises — the argv router
    serves each call its own view of `sys.argv`.
