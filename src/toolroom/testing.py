"""Canned answers for bridge calls — toolroom's own test double.

The handles under test stay real. `answers()` swaps nothing above the
seam, so chaining, flag translation, the `off` sentinel, secrets
redaction, colour switches and `input=` consumption are all the
bridge's own, exercised exactly as a live call would exercise them.
Only execution is replaced: every call leaves through `_host.run` and
every version read through `_host.probe`, and for the span of the block
those two doors answer from a table instead of spawning.

    from toolroom.testing import answers

    with answers({
        ("uv", "tool", "list"): "hse-devkit v0.0.18\\n- hse\\n",
        ("git", "push"): 1,
    }) as calls:
        release()                       # code under test, real handles

    assert calls[0].argv[:3] == ["uv", "tool", "list"]

Keys are argv prefixes, matched against the *name-led* spelling of each
call (`git …`, `python …` — never the resolved interpreter path); the
longest matching prefix wins, and a string key is split on whitespace
as a convenience. Values are the answer: a `str` is stdout with exit 0,
an `int` is an exit code, a `Result` sets the code and both streams. An
unmatched call succeeds silently — exit 0, empty streams — so
`answers()` with no table is a pure call recorder. A non-zero answer
takes the failing lane honestly: returned under `nofail`, raised
otherwise.

This is a different instrument from footman's `recording()`: a
recording is a rehearsal inside the real world (nothing executes,
everything succeeds, value reads opted `recorded=False` still answer
truthfully), where `answers()` *replaces* the world — version probes
included, which is why an unmatched probe refuses loudly instead of
answering empty. Nested inside a `recording()` block, `answers()` wins:
it intercepts upstream of footman, so its answers stand and the
recording sees nothing.

    An unmatched *call* is often incidental — the recorder default

    bug in the making: an answer was canned to steer the code under
    test and never served, usually because the key was mis-spelt,
    path-led where matching is name-led, or split into the wrong
    tokens, and the test passes vacuously as if the entry did not
    exist. A warning rather than an error so a deliberately shared
    table (one fixture serving several tests, each exercising a subset)
    can filter it; escalate it to a failure with `-W error` or a

class Call:
    """One intercepted call: what would have run, and what was handed.

    `argv` is the name-led spelling — raw tokens, assert-friendly.
    `raw` is what would actually have spawned: resolved interpreter
    path, forced colour switch and all (the same pairing footman's
    steps keep as `.command`/`.raw`). `command` is the shown line,
    values quoted and secrets redacted.

    `args` and `kwargs` are the call *as the caller wrote it*,
    pre-render: positionals verbatim (a `Path` stays a `Path`), and the
    call keywords with **False values included** — the bridge omits a
    False flag from the argv, the record must not, because "never
    handed" and "handed, as False" are different facts and tests assert
    on both. The rule of thumb: assert on `kwargs` for what the code
    decided to pass, on `argv` for what would have run. `.flags()`
    keywords are part of the handle, rendered into the verb path before
    any call exists, so they show only in `argv`/`raw`; run policy
    stays in `opts`.

    `env` is the environment the call handed the seam (`None`
    inherits); `opts` carries the rest of the run policy (`nofail`,
    `capture`, `input`, `cwd`, `timeout`, …) exactly as it crossed.
    `probe` marks a version read — a probe has no call of its own, so
    its `args`/`kwargs` are `()` and `{}` by construction.
