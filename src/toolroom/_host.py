"""The seam between the bridge and whatever executes its calls.

toolroom is vocabulary-complete on its own, and the seam speaks stdlib:
the bridge hands this module a `list[str]` plus run policy, and gets
back an int-with-attributes. When footman is present in the process,
every call routes through footman's `run()` — receipts, capture,
dry-run, `recording()`, lanes — without footman ever importing (or even
knowing about) toolroom. When it is not, a plain subprocess executor
answers with toolroom's own `Result`.

Detection keys on *orchestration*, not mere presence: a call routes
hosted only when a footman context is actually live — a task body, a
`parallel()` worker, a `recording()` block — because that is when
receipts, dry-run, and recording must be impossible to bypass. A bare
call in a process that merely *imported* footman (a pytest run
auto-loading footman's plugin, an app embedding both) takes the
standalone executor and standalone semantics, deterministically: which
exception a failure raises must never depend on what some other module
imported. An installed-but-never-imported footman does not make this a
footman process either, and importing it here would change the process
just to answer a question about it.

The hosted branch's lazy imports reach the same names the in-tree
bridge imports today. When footman grows a named executor contract,
this module is the only place that changes.

    An ordinary `list[str]` everywhere in Python: it indexes, slices,

    runner spawns it as-is. Always the raw tokens — the one shape of a

    a wrapper takes them splatted (`uv.run("--", *cmd)`), and stdlib
    helpers take the list directly (`shlex.join(cmd)`).

    The moment the line is about to cross into a shell, name that shell:

    * `.posix()` — one string, `shlex`-quoted for `sh`/`bash`/`zsh`.
    * `.windows()` — one string, quoted the way `CreateProcess` parses.

    Naming it is the caller's job because toolroom cannot know it: the
    same handle can target different hosts across calls, the OS does not
    determine the shell, and the payload may reach no shell at all. The
    quoting is the *destination's*, never this machine's.
