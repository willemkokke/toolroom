"""Fetch the latest curated tools into a throwaway prefix — the engine behind
`fm tools.provision`.

The stubs are read from the *installed* binaries (`fm tools.sync`), so
telling an editor what the newest release accepts means having the newest
release on `PATH` — across five ecosystems (PyPI, npm, bun, Go, C++), none of
which should be allowed to touch the machine's own environment.

One isolated prefix answers all of it. Almost every curated tool ships an
installable PyPI wheel — including the Rust ones (ruff, uv, prek, git-cliff)
and the C++ ones (cmake, ninja) — so `uv tool install --upgrade` into a
private `UV_TOOL_DIR`/`UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` covers the majority and cleans up with
one `rm -rf`. What's left is bun (its own release), the node CLIs it installs,
and the Go CLIs (a prebuilt release asset):

* **uv** — `uv tool install --upgrade <pkg>`, tools and launchers under the
  prefix; nothing lands in `~/.local` or the system site-packages.
* **bun** — bun's GitHub release, unpacked into the prefix. Provisioned
  *first*, because the node tier runs through it.
* **node** — `bun add --global` with `BUN_INSTALL` pointed at the prefix.
* **github / gitlab** — the latest release asset for this platform, matched
  from the release's own asset list (so `Darwin`/`x86_64` vs `darwin`/`x64`
  naming needn't be transcribed), unpacked, binary placed in the prefix.
* **system** — git, docker, the uv running this: already on `PATH`, left be.
* **deferred** — parked, with a reason (tea, until it stops hanging on
  `--help`).

Everything writes under one prefix and `PATH="<prefix>/bin:$PATH"` is all a
`sync` needs to read the newest binaries; deleting the prefix undoes it. This
is a maintainer tool: it shells out and downloads, and it is never on the
completion hot path.

    GitHub allows 60 unauthenticated API calls an hour *per IP* and 5,000 with

    the IP is a shared CI runner, where the budget is spent by whoever else is
    on it; a prime that walks ten releases each is then throttled by strangers.

    Read from the environment rather than fetched from `gh`, so nothing here
    depends on a CLI being installed: `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` locally, and
    `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` in Actions. Absent, everything still works — just
