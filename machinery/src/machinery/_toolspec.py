"""What a command-line tool says about itself — extracted, not transcribed.

The `tools.*` bridge translates keyword arguments mechanically, which is
what keeps it from going stale the way hand-written wrappers do. But two
things about a tool cannot be derived from the call: what its options
*mean*, and how it spells a negation.

The second one is a bug, not a nicety. `off` emits `--no-<name>`, which
is right for most tools and wrong for enough to matter: `mkdocs build
--no-clean` is rejected outright — the flag is `--dirty` — and five of
mkdocs' eight negatable options disagree with the convention. Only the
tool knows, so footman asks it.

Extraction, richest first:

* **click** — `Command.params` carries `opts`, `secondary_opts` (the true
  negation), the default, the help text, and the type, as data. No
  parsing, no guessing.
* **argparse / optparse** — walk the parser's actions (to come).
* **`--help` text** — for the Rust and Go tools, whose output is regular
  and which often spell the negation in prose (clap: "Use
  `--no-unsafe-fixes` to disable"). To come.

Nothing here runs on the completion hot path, and nothing here is
imported by `tools.py` at call time: the extracted facts are baked into
a table and a stub, and the extractor only runs when regenerating them.
