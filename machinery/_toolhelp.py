"""Read a tool's own `--help` and turn it into a `ToolSpec`.

The structural extractors in `_toolspec` are better when they apply — click
and argparse hand over their parameters as data. But most of the tools a
task actually calls are Rust, Go or Node binaries with no Python parser to
introspect: ruff and uv (clap), docker (cobra), cspell and markdownlint
(commander), git (its own). For those, the tool's `--help` is the only
description it offers, and it is far more regular than it looks.

Every one of those help formats prints an option as a line that starts with
a dash, followed by help text that is either on the same line past a run of
spaces, or on the lines below indented deeper:

    clap        --fix
                    Apply fixes to resolve lint violations. Use `--no-fix`
                    to disable

    optparse    -d DIR, --directory=DIR
                        Write the output files to DIR.

    cobra       -f, --file stringArray   Compose configuration files

So one parser reads them all: find the lines that start an option, split the
flag spellings from the prose, and glue on the continuation lines. What
differs between the families is only how they spell a *default* and a
*negation*, and those are small dialects on top (`[default: 3]`,
`(default true)`, "Use `--no-fix` to disable").

Nothing here runs at task time. The extractor runs when a maintainer
regenerates the stubs, and `fm tools.audit` compares what it finds
against what is checked in.
