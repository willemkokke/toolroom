"""The curated tools, and the little each one needs said about it.

Extraction is generic — `_toolspec` reads a click command's parameters,
`_toolhelp` reads anybody's `--help` — so a driver is not a wrapper. It
carries only what a tool cannot tell you by being asked:

* **which verbs are worth stubbing.** `docker --help` lists forty commands
  and `git` has hundreds; a stub of all of them would be a megabyte nobody
  reads. The list here is the verbs tasks actually call.
* **the quirks.** git's `--help` opens a man page, so it wants `-h`. A tool
  whose real name differs from its attribute (`markdownlint-cli2` is
  `tools.markdownlint`) says so.
* **the default.** Whether `tools.<name>` runs in-process by default, which
  mirrors how it is constructed in `tools.py`.

Everything else — the flags, their help, their types, the negations — comes
from the installed tool, every time the stubs are regenerated.
