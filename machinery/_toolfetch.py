"""Past releases of a curated tool, for priming its option history.

Provisioning fetches the *latest* of everything into one prefix. Priming is
the other direction: one specific release at a time, into a throwaway
environment, read once and thrown away — walking backwards from the newest
because the current version is the one that matters most, and because a
backward walk appends to the history rather than rewriting it.

The listable tiers: PyPI (`uv`), npm (`node`), release assets from GitHub,
GitLab and Gitea — which covers bun's own releases too — CPython, whose
index is the provisioned uv's own, and docker's static-build directory.
What remains unlistable is the `system` tier (git, read from the host). A
tool footman cannot list is named and skipped rather than silently treated
as having no history — the same doctrine `audit` follows.

"""When each CPython arrived, newest first — the eras a release is read in.

A release has to be read in roughly the world it shipped into or it cannot
be read at all: twine 5.1.0 indexes `metadata["home-page"]` at import, a key
`importlib_metadata` 8 stopped returning and started raising `KeyError` on,
so under today's resolution it dies before argparse runs. `--exclude-newer`
at the release's own date fixes that, and only resolves on an interpreter
old enough to have wheels from that date — a 2022 `cryptography` has no
cp314 build and will not compile against one.

So the interpreter is the newest CPython that existed when the release
shipped, not one fixed version. That is what makes the reading *of its
era* rather than merely old: a 2026 release is read on 3.14 exactly as it
is today, and a 2022 release on 3.11, because that is what anyone running
it then would have seen.

It also settles what a fixed floor could not. Python 3.13 taught argparse
to print every alias, so pytest reports `--junitxml` alongside
`--junit-xml` there and only `--junit-xml` below it. Reading everything on
one old interpreter would have quietly dropped those aliases from releases
that really do show them; reading each release in its own era records the
aliases exactly where they appeared, and the surface corrects itself as the
walk crosses October 2024.

Upstream release days, not the build dates in uv's index — python-build-
standalone shipped 3.11 in January 2023, three months late, which would
have read that autumn's releases on 3.10.
