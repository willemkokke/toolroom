"""Keep the `tools.*` stubs honest — `fm tools …`.

The bridge never goes stale, because it transcribes nothing. Its *stub*
can: a stub is a description of a tool at a version, and tools move. These
tasks close that gap by regenerating the description from the installed
tools and by failing a check when the two disagree.

    fm tools.list                  what footman curates, and what's installed
    fm tools.spec ruff             what one tool says about itself, right now
    fm tools.sync                  rewrite the stubs from the installed tools
    fm tools.audit                 which tools have moved past their snapshot
    fm tools.color                 how footman forces colour, per tool

A stub is a snapshot, not a contract: `sync` takes one, `audit` says which
tools have released a newer version since. Being behind is news rather than
a fault, so `audit` reports and exits zero unless you ask for `--strict`,
and the snapshots are retaken at release time rather than the moment a tool
ships. A snapshot only ever moves forward: a tool that isn't installed, is
missing from a `--prefix`, or reads older than the stub already records is
named and left alone — a check that quietly covered three of thirteen would
be worse than no check.

    uv writes to two places of its own accord, and neither is ours to fill:
    a wheel cache, and the store its managed interpreters live in — the one
    holding the pythons this machine actually runs. A prime of CPython's
    releases put 90 interpreters in that store and left them there, because
    nothing in this file had reason to think it owned them.

    Pointing both inside the scratch directory makes the cleanup structural
    rather than a rule someone has to remember: one `rmtree` at the end
    removes every byte the walk caused, and the interpreter you develop
    against is never a candidate for deletion in the first place.

    `UV_NO_CACHE` is the other half, and the half that decides whether a
    walk fits on the disk at all. `_discard` deletes each release once its
    surface is read, but uv had already unpacked that release's wheels —
    and each CPython's tarball — into its cache, where nothing collects
    them until the run ends. Peak disk then tracked how many releases the
    walk performed instead of how many it held at once: a full gather put
    5 GB into `archive-v0` while the interpreter store sat at 110 MB and
    the venvs churned between 1 MB and 361 MB. That is a wall a CI runner
    meets sooner than a laptop does.

    A cache buys nothing here in any case. It lives inside *scratch*, which
    is created for this walk and deleted at the end of it, so no entry
    written has ever been read by a second run. Turning it off costs the
    re-download of shared dependencies within a run and bounds peak disk by
    concurrency — which is the trade to make, because the walk is parallel

# Tools

Import a tool by name — `from footman.tools import git` — and call it,
`git.commit(…)`. No declaration needed: [the bridge](../../tools-bridge.md)
translates keyword arguments into flags mechanically, and every tool on
your PATH already works. These pages document the **stubs**: what each
curated tool accepted at the version footman last read it from, with that
tool's own help text per flag.

Nothing here is a wrapper. The stubs are generated by `fm tools.sync`,
which asks the installed binaries what they take, and `fm tools.audit`
reports which tools have released a newer version since. A flag missing
from a stub still runs — every verb ends in `**flags: Any`, so a stub can
suggest but never forbid.

Where a flag defaults *on*, its documentation names the spelling that
turns it off, because that is the one thing the bridge cannot infer:
`clean=off` emits `mkdocs build --dirty`, not `--no-clean`.

The **In-process** column is a deliberate choice, not a capability dump.
Tasks run concurrently as threads, and a tool call is normally a subprocess —
isolated, trivially parallel. A Python tool with a `[console_scripts]` entry
point *can* run in footman's own process instead, skipping the spawn:

- **default** — footman prefers in-process. `mkdocs` (macOS strips `DYLD_*`
  from subprocesses, so cairo only resolves in-process), `zensical` and
  `coverage` (pure Python) qualify, and their entry points accept an argument
  list, so they stay parallel.
- **available** — an entry point exists but running it in-process buys
  nothing: `basedpyright` ships a Python launcher that just spawns node, so
  footman subprocesses it anyway.
- **no** — a Rust/Go/Node binary with no Python entry point; always a
  subprocess.

See [the tools bridge](../../tools-bridge.md#parallelism) for how in-process
tools stay parallel (and the one case that can't).
