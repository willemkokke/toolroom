"""What each curated tool accepted, release by release.

A stub is a rendering, not a record. The record is one JSON file per tool
under `_history/`: the **newest** observed release stored whole, and every
older one a delta describing how to step back to it.

Pointing the deltas backwards is what makes the format fit the work:

* priming backwards is pure append — an older release adds one delta against
  the current oldest, and nothing already written is touched;
* the current version costs no replay, because it *is* the base;
* midfill rewrites exactly one entry, the inserted release's successor;
* "did anything change in this release" is "is its delta non-empty", which
  is the question a release job actually asks.

`since` / `until` are never stored. They are derived by walking the chain,
so a half-primed file can never assert history it has not looked at —
`observed_from` says how far back the chain reaches, and that is a fact
about what was read rather than a policy about what we meant to read.
